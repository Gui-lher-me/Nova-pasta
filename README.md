# DROPCOMMERCE - Project Folder Structure Breakdown

## Overview

This project uses a modular, feature-driven design optimized for scalability, reusability, and separation of concerns. Built with Next.js 13's App Router, this structure ensures smooth navigation, maintainability, and efficient organization for future growth.

**Developed by: Guilherme G Silva**

### `app/` Folder

This folder houses the **App Router** introduced in Next.js 13, which manages routing and page-level concerns.

- **store/** and **supplier/**:
  - These are distinct routes or applications under `app/`, each containing specific pages (`page.js` or `layout.js`) to align with Next.js's file-based routing.
  - **Purpose**: Serve as primary entry points for features like the e-commerce store and supplier management.

### `components/` Folder

This folder contains **Shared UI components** (e.g., buttons, modals), ensuring reuse across the application.

### `constants/` Folder

This folder holds **Global constants** such as settings, configurations, and enums.

### `features/` Folder

This folder organizes **feature-based modules**, encapsulating domain-specific logic, UI components, and server-side actions.

- **store/** and **supplier/**:
  - Subfolders that align with specific features or domains, housing business logic and components tailored to store and supplier functionalities.

### `icons/` Folder

This folder holds **Icon components** or related assets.

### `lib/` Folder

This folder stores **Utility functions** and libraries, such as custom helpers or integrations (e.g., Cloudinary).

### `providers/` Folder

This folder contains **Context providers** for global state management (e.g., Theme), maintaining a unified state across components.

## Design Explanation

### Separation of Concerns

- **app/**: Manages routing and page structure, separate from business logic.
- **components/**: Contains reusable UI components for consistent design across the app.
- **constants/**: Stores global application settings and enums.
- **features/**: Houses feature-specific logic (e.g., store, supplier) for organized development.
- **icons/**: Centralizes icon components.
- **lib/**: Offers utilities and helpers, usable across the app to avoid redundancy.
- **providers/**: Manages global state with context providers.

### Scalability

- This structure supports the addition of new features or modules with minimal impact on the existing app.
- Feature directories under `features/` allow the app to grow without disrupting its organization.

### Reusability

- Centralized logic in `lib/` and shared UI components in `components/` ensure **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles.
- Shared functionality remains accessible across various app features, promoting efficiency.

## Best Practices Used

### Feature Isolation

- Features (e.g., `store`, `supplier`) are self-contained within `features/`, organizing logic and UI components specific to each domain.
- Isolation fosters independent development and easier maintenance.

### Centralized Dependencies

- The `lib/` directory centralizes logic and shared components, reducing code duplication and ensuring consistency.

### Scalable Routing

- Nested routes under `app/` (e.g., `store/`, `supplier/`) allow for a scalable and intuitive routing structure.
- Each subfolder acts as an entry point for its domain, facilitating navigation and modularity.
